CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting
 by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had p
eeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversati
ons in it, â€˜and what is the use of a book,â€™ thought Alice â€˜without picture
s or conversations?â€™ So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she co
uld, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
 of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking th
e daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There w
as nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out o
f the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, â€˜Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late
!â€™ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to 
have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when th
e Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, an
d then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind tha
t she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch 
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it
, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under 
the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering ho
w in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
 tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had 
not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling do
wn a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for
 she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what wa
s going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was 
coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of 
the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; her
e and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from o
ne of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled â€˜ORANGE MARMALADEâ€™, but to 
her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
 of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell
 past it. â€˜Well!â€™ thought Alice to herself, â€˜after such a fall as this, I 
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâ€™ll all think me at
 home! Why, I wouldnâ€™t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of th
e house!â€™ (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall never
 come to an end! â€˜I wonder how many miles Iâ€™ve fallen by this time?â€™ she s
aid aloud. â€˜I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me s
ee: that would be four thousand miles down, I thinkâ€”â€™ (for, you see, Alice h
ad learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and thou
gh this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there 
was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) â€˜â€”ye
s, thatâ€™s about the right distanceâ€”but then I wonder what Latitude or Longit
ude Iâ€™ve got to?â€™ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either,
 but thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again. â€˜I
 wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny itâ€™ll seem to come 
out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thi
nkâ€”â€™ (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didnâ
€™t sound at all the right word) â€˜â€”but I shall have to ask them what the nam
e of the country is, you know. Please, Maâ€™am, is this New Zealand or Australia
?â€™ (and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâ€”fancy curtseying as youâ€™re falli
ng through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) â€˜And what an ignorant l
ittle girl sheâ€™ll think me for asking! No, itâ€™ll never do to ask: perhaps I 
shall see it written up somewhere.â€™ Down, down, down. There was nothing else t
o do, so Alice soon began talking again. â€˜Dinahâ€™ll miss me very much to-nigh
t, I should think!â€™ (Dinah was the cat.) â€˜I hope theyâ€™ll remember her sauc
er of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There 
are no mice in the air, Iâ€™m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâ€™s ve
ry like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?â€™ And here Alice beg
an to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way,
 â€˜Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?â€™ and sometimes, â€˜Do bats eat cats?â€
™ for, you see, as she couldnâ€™t answer either question, it didnâ€™t much matte
r which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to 
dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earne
stly, â€˜Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?â€™ when suddenly
, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall
 was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a momen
t: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long pass
age, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a 
moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear i
t say, as it turned a corner, â€˜Oh my ears and whiskers, how late itâ€™s gettin
g!â€™ She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no 
longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a 
row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but the
y were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the 
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she wa
s ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all
 made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alic
eâ€™s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; bu
t, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any r
ate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came u
pon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door ab
out fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her
 great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a sma
ll passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
 passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of th
at dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool
 fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; â€˜and even
 if my head would go through,â€™ thought poor Alice, â€˜it would be of very litt
le use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I 
think I could, if I only knew how to begin.â€™ For, you see, so many out-of-the-
way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few thin
gs indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the li
ttle door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key
 on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: t
his time she found a little bottle on it, (â€˜which certainly was not here befor
e,â€™ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the 
words â€˜DRINK MEâ€™ beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very
 well to say â€˜Drink me,â€™ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that 
in a hurry. â€˜No, Iâ€™ll look first,â€™ she said, â€˜and see whether itâ€™s mar
ked â€œpoisonâ€? or notâ€™; for she had read several nice little histories about
 children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant th
ings, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had tau
ght them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; a
nd that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and 
she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked â€˜poison,â
€™ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bot
tle was not marked â€˜poison,â€™ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it v
ery nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pin
e-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished i
t off. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * â€˜What a curious feeling!â€™ sai
d Alice; â€˜I must be shutting up like a telescope.â€™ And so it was indeed: she
 was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that sh
e was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely gard
en. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shri
nk any further: she felt a little nervous about this; â€˜for it might end, you k
now,â€™ said Alice to herself, â€˜in my going out altogether, like a candle. I w
onder what I should be like then?â€™ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a 
candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever ha
ving seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she d
ecided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got 
to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she wen
t back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could
 see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one 
of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired hersel
f out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. â€˜Come, thereâ€™s 
no use in crying like that!â€™ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; â€˜I advis
e you to leave off this minute!â€™ She generally gave herself very good advice, 
(though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so sever
ely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her o
wn ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against 
herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. â€
˜But itâ€™s no use now,â€™ thought poor Alice, â€˜to pretend to be two people! W
hy, thereâ€™s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!â€™ Soon h
er eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it,
 and found in it a very small cake, on which the words â€˜EAT MEâ€™ were beautif
ully marked in currants. â€˜Well, Iâ€™ll eat it,â€™ said Alice, â€˜and if it mak
es me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can c
reep under the door; so either way Iâ€™ll get into the garden, and I donâ€™t car
e which happens!â€™ She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, â€˜Whic
h way? Which way?â€™, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way 
it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same s
ize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so
 much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, tha
t it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she se
t to work, and very soon finished off the cake. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears â€˜Curiouser and curiouser!â€™ cried Alice
 (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak g
ood English); â€˜now Iâ€™m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
 Good-bye, feet!â€™ (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be alm
ost out of sight, they were getting so far off). â€˜Oh, my poor little feet, I w
onder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? Iâ€™m sure I 
shanâ€™t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about yo
u: you must manage the best way you can;â€”but I must be kind to them,â€™ though
t Alice, â€˜or perhaps they wonâ€™t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: Iâ€™l
l give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.â€™ And she went on planning to 
herself how she would manage it. â€˜They must go by the carrier,â€™ she thought;
 â€˜and how funny itâ€™ll seem, sending presents to oneâ€™s own feet! And how od
d the directions will look! Aliceâ€™s Right Foot, Esq. Hearthrug, near The Fende
r, (with Aliceâ€™s love). Oh dear, what nonsense Iâ€™m talking!â€™ Just then her
 head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine fe
et high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the ga
rden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, t
o look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeles
s than ever: she sat down and began to cry again. â€˜You ought to be ashamed of 
yourself,â€™ said Alice, â€˜a great girl like you,â€™ (she might well say this),
 â€˜to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!â€™ But she went o
n all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all roun
d her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. After a time she 
heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes
 to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, 
with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he cam
e trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, â€˜Oh! the D
uchess, the Duchess! Oh! wonâ€™t she be savage if Iâ€™ve kept her waiting!â€™ Al
ice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Ra
bbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, â€˜If you please, sirâ€”â€
™ The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and sk
urried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice took up the fan and 
gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she
 went on talking: â€˜Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday t
hings went on just as usual. I wonder if Iâ€™ve been changed in the night? Let m
e think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remembe
r feeling a little different. But if Iâ€™m not the same, the next question is, W
ho in the world am I? Ah, thatâ€™s the great puzzle!â€™ And she began thinking o
ver all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if sh
e could have been changed for any of them. â€˜Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not Ada,â€™ she s
aid, â€˜for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesnâ€™t go in ringle
ts at all; and Iâ€™m sure I canâ€™t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, an
d she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, sheâ€™s she, and Iâ€™m I, andâ
€”oh dear, how puzzling it all is! Iâ€™ll try if I know all the things I used to
 know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, an
d four times seven isâ€”oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! Howev
er, the Multiplication Table doesnâ€™t signify: letâ€™s try Geography. London is
 the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Romeâ€”no, thatâ€™s
 all wrong, Iâ€™m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! Iâ€™ll try and sa
y â€œHow doth the littleâ€”â€œâ€™ and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she
 were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and s
trange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:â€” â€˜How doth t
he little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On
 every golden scale! â€˜How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his c
laws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m sure th
ose are not the right words,â€™ said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears 
again as she went on, â€˜I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and l
ive in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ev
er so many lessons to learn! No, Iâ€™ve made up my mind about it; if Iâ€™m Mabel
, Iâ€™ll stay down here! Itâ€™ll be no use their putting their heads down and sa
ying â€œCome up again, dear!â€? I shall only look up and say â€œWho am I then? T
ell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, Iâ€™ll come up: if not
, Iâ€™ll stay down here till Iâ€™m somebody elseâ€?â€”but, oh dear!â€™ cried Ali
ce, with a sudden burst of tears, â€˜I do wish they would put their heads down! 
I am so very tired of being all alone here!â€™ As she said this she looked down 
at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbitâ€™s
 little white kid gloves while she was talking. â€˜How can I have done that?â€™ 
she thought. â€˜I must be growing small again.â€™ She got up and went to the tab
le to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she w
as now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found o
ut that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastil
y, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. â€˜That was a narrow escape!
â€™ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to fi
nd herself still in existence; â€˜and now for the garden!â€™ and she ran with al
l speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and 
the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, â€˜and things are 
worse than ever,â€™ thought the poor child, â€˜for I never was so small as this 
before, never! And I declare itâ€™s too bad, that it is!â€™ As she said these wo
rds her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in s
alt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, â€˜and i
n that case I can go back by railway,â€™ she said to herself. (Alice had been to
 the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wher
ever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
 sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodgin
g houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that sh
e was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. â€˜I 
wish I hadnâ€™t cried so much!â€™ said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find 
her way out. â€˜I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in m
y own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is quee
r to-day.â€™ Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little 
way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it mu
st be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, a
nd she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. 
â€˜Would it be of any use, now,â€™ thought Alice, â€˜to speak to this mouse? Eve
rything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can t
alk: at any rate, thereâ€™s no harm in trying.â€™ So she began: â€˜O Mouse, do y
ou know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mous
e!â€™ (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had 
never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brotherâ€™
s Latin Grammar, â€˜A mouseâ€”of a mouseâ€”to a mouseâ€”a mouseâ€”O mouse!â€™) T
he Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one 
of its little eyes, but it said nothing. â€˜Perhaps it doesnâ€™t understand Engl
ish,â€™ thought Alice; â€˜I daresay itâ€™s a French mouse, come over with Willia
m the Conqueror.â€™ (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very c
lear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: â€˜Ou est m
a chatte?â€™ which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse g
ave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. â
€˜Oh, I beg your pardon!â€™ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the po
or animalâ€™s feelings. â€˜I quite forgot you didnâ€™t like cats.â€™ â€˜Not like
 cats!â€™ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. â€˜Would you like cats
 if you were me?â€™ â€˜Well, perhaps not,â€™ said Alice in a soothing tone: â€˜d
onâ€™t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think
 youâ€™d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quie
t thing,â€™ Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool
, â€˜and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing he
r faceâ€”and she is such a nice soft thing to nurseâ€”and sheâ€™s such a capital
 one for catching miceâ€”oh, I beg your pardon!â€™ cried Alice again, for this t
ime the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really off
ended. â€˜We wonâ€™t talk about her any more if youâ€™d rather not.â€™ â€˜We ind
eed!â€™ cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. â€˜As if
 I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulga
r things! Donâ€™t let me hear the name again!â€™ â€˜I wonâ€™t indeed!â€™ said Al
ice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. â€˜Are youâ€”are yo
u fondâ€”ofâ€”of dogs?â€™ The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: â€
˜There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A lit
tle bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itâ€
™ll fetch things when you throw them, and itâ€™ll sit up and beg for its dinner,
 and all sorts of thingsâ€”I canâ€™t remember half of themâ€”and it belongs to a
 farmer, you know, and he says itâ€™s so useful, itâ€™s worth a hundred pounds! 
He says it kills all the rats andâ€”oh dear!â€™ cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
 â€˜Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ve offended it again!â€™ For the Mouse was swimming away fr
om her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it we
nt. So she called softly after it, â€˜Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won
â€™t talk about cats or dogs either, if you donâ€™t like them!â€™ When the Mouse
 heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pal
e (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, â€˜Let us
 get to the shore, and then Iâ€™ll tell you my history, and youâ€™ll understand 
why it is I hate cats and dogs.â€™ It was high time to go, for the pool was gett
ing quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were
 a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. A
lice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
