CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting
 by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had p
eeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversati
ons in it, â€˜and what is the use of a book,â€™ thought Alice â€˜without picture
s or conversations?â€™ So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she co
uld, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
 of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking th
e daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There w
as nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out o
f the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, â€˜Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late
!â€™ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to 
have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when th
e Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, an
d then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind tha
t she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch 
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it
, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under 
the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering ho
w in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
 tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had 
not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling do
wn a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for
 she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what wa
s going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was 
coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of 
the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; her
e and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from o
ne of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled â€˜ORANGE MARMALADEâ€™, but to 
her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
 of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell
 past it. â€˜Well!â€™ thought Alice to herself, â€˜after such a fall as this, I 
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâ€™ll all think me at
 home! Why, I wouldnâ€™t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of th
e house!â€™ (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER
 come to an end! â€˜I wonder how many miles Iâ€™ve fallen by this time?â€™ she s
aid aloud. â€˜I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me s
ee: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--â€™ (for, you see, Alice ha
d learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and thoug
h this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there w
as no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) â€˜--yes,
 thatâ€™s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude
 Iâ€™ve got to?â€™ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, bu
t thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again. â€˜I wo
nder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny itâ€™ll seem to come out
 among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think-
-â€™ (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didnâ€™t 
sound at all the right word) â€˜--but I shall have to ask them what the name of 
the country is, you know. Please, Maâ€™am, is this New Zealand or Australia?â€™ 
(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as youâ€™re falling thr
ough the air! Do you think you could manage it?) â€˜And what an ignorant little 
girl sheâ€™ll think me for asking! No, itâ€™ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall 
see it written up somewhere.â€™ Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, 
so Alice soon began talking again. â€˜Dinahâ€™ll miss me very much to-night, I s
hould think!â€™ (Dinah was the cat.) â€˜I hope theyâ€™ll remember her saucer of 
milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
 mice in the air, Iâ€™m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâ€™s very lik
e a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?â€™ And here Alice began to 
get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, â€˜Do
 cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?â€™ and sometimes, â€˜Do bats eat cats?â€™ for,
 you see, as she couldnâ€™t answer either question, it didnâ€™t much matter whic
h way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream 
that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 
â€˜Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?â€™ when suddenly, thum
p! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was o
ver. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she
 looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, a
nd the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment
 to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say,
 as it turned a corner, â€˜Oh my ears and whiskers, how late itâ€™s getting!â€™ 
She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer
 to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
 lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were
 all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other,
 trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever
 to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made 
of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Aliceâ€™s 
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, ala
s! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it
 would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a 
low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fi
fteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great
 delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small pas
sage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passa
ge into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dar
k hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fount
ains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; â€˜and even if my
 head would go through,â€™ thought poor Alice, â€˜it would be of very little use
 without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think 
I could, if I only knew how to begin.â€™ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way th
ings had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things ind
eed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little d
oor, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it
, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this ti
me she found a little bottle on it, [â€˜which certainly was not here before,â€™ 
said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 
â€˜DRINK MEâ€™ beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well 
to say â€˜Drink me,â€™ but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a h
urry. â€˜No, Iâ€™ll look first,â€™ she said, â€˜and see whether itâ€™s marked â€
œpoisonâ€? or notâ€™; for she had read several nice little histories about child
ren who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant th
